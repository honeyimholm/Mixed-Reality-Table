# Mixed Reality Table

This is project is a mixed reality table where users can interact physically with the surface of the table by placing objects, which are then detected by the camera system, and passed to the application or game being run, which is projected back onto the table for users to see

The table can support a multitude of interactive experiences, The first we explored was a topdown 2D shooter game controlled by the user with a keyboard, where objects placed on the table became obstacles in game.
